# TaxServiceAssessment

This is my attempt at a Tax Service client that can be hooked into any TaxCalculator API it could need; 

I was unsure of what information needed to be returned, so I had it just return the CombinedRate (Standard rate if that wasnt present in the results)
and the amount_to_collect values as doubles.
